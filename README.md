# TinyMUD
 The public repo for TinyMUD

 TinyMUD is a thought experiment in revisiting the concept of a minimalistic, extensible, and modular [MUD (Multi-User Dungeon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon) server, utilizing cutting edge software. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to extend, allowing developers to create their own game worlds and mechanics.

## Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: TinyMUD focuses on the core aspects of MUD gameplay, providing a simple yet powerful foundation for developers.
- **Extensibility**: The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new features and mechanics, enabling developers to customize their game worlds.
- **Lightweight**: The TinyMUD client is less than 10mb in size, as small as a .png file.
- **Cutting Edge Technology**: Leveraging Godot 4, TinyMUD aims to provide a state-of-the-art development experience.
