# CommandParser.gd

# input into game actions. In our multiplayer architecture, its role is now
# split: it receives commands from clients via RPC and executes them
# authoritatively on the host.

# --- RPC Function ---
# This is the new entry point for all player commands. The `@rpc` decorator
# allows it to be called from clients.
# `any_peer`: Allows any peer (client) to call this function on the host.
# `reliable`: Ensures the call is reliable and ordered.

	# call this on themselves, this check would prevent it.
	if not multiplayer.is_server():
