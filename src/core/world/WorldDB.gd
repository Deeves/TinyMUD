# This autoload singleton acts as the central, in-memory database for the

# active players. All other systems (CommandParser, NetworkManager, etc.)
# will interact with this singleton to query and modify the game state.
# This centralized approach is essential for maintaining a single,
# authoritative source of truth on the session host.
