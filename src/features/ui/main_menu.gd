# MainMenu.gd
# This script controls the user interface for the main menu screen.
# Its responsibilities are:
# 1. Handling user input from buttons (Host, Join).
# 2. Interfacing with the NetworkManager autoload singleton to initiate
#    hosting or joining a game session.
# 3. Displaying feedback to the user, such as the Session ID when hosting,
#    or error messages if a connection fails.
# 4. Listening for signals from the NetworkManager to know when to transition
#    to the main game scene.
